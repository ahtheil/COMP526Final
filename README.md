# COMP526Final
Final Project for Comp Sci 526

I must chose both a topic choice, and a programing language to write the topic in. Currently I am thinking about using Fortran just because I have more recent experience in the language. While C was definately stronger for me, and starting to learn fortran was extremely difficult, at this ppoint I have done enough fortran that I might wwant to just do the final in fortran instead of C... we shall see
